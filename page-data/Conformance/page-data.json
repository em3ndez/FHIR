However, the FHIR specification is very broad and not all implementations are expected to implement every feature. We prioritize performance and configurability over spec coverage.\n\n## Capability statement\nThe HL7 FHIR specification defines [an interaction](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities) for retrieving a machine-readable description of the server's capabilities via the `[base]/metadata` endpoint. The IBM FHIR Server implements this interaction and generates a `CapabilityStatement` resource based on the current server configuration. While the `CapabilityStatement` resource is ideal for certain uses, this markdown document provides a human-readable summary of important details, with a special focus on limitations of the current implementation and deviations from the specification.\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server supports only version 4.0.1 of the specification and ignores the optional MIME-type parameter `fhirVersion`.\n\n## FHIR HTTP API\nThe HL7 FHIR specification is more than just a data format. It defines an [HTTP API](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html) for creating, reading, updating, deleting, and searching over FHIR resources. The IBM FHIR Server implements almost the full API for every resource defined in the specification, with the following exceptions:\n* history is only supported at the resource instance level (no resource type history and no whole-system history)\n* there are parts of the FHIR search specification which are not fully implemented as documented in the following section\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server implements a linear versioning scheme for resources and fully implements the `vread` and `history` interactions, as well as version-aware updates.\n\n### Extended operations\nThe HL7 FHIR specification also defines a mechanism for extending the base API with [extended operations](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/operations.html).\nThe IBM FHIR Server implements a handful of extended operations and provides extension points for users to extend the server with their own.\n\nOperations are invoked via HTTP POST.\n* All operations can be invoked by passing a Parameters resource instance in the body of the request.\n* For operations with no input parameters, no body is required.\n* For operations with a single input parameter named \"resource\", the Parameters wrapper can be omitted.\n\nAlternatively, for operations with only simple input parameters (i.e. no complex datatypes like 'Identifier' or 'Reference'), operations can be invoked via HTTP GET by passing the parameters in the URL.\n\n#### System operations\nSystem operations are invoked at `[base]/$[operation]`\n\n|Operation|Short Description|Notes|\n|---------|-----------------|-----|\n| [$convert](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/resource-operation-convert.html) | Takes a resource in one form and returns it in another | Converts between JSON and XML but *not* between FHIR versions |\n| [$export](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/STU1/OperationDefinition-export.html) | Export data from the server | exports to an S3-compatible data store; see the [user guide](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/guides/FHIRServerUsersGuide#4101-bulk-data-export) for config info |\n| [$import](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/bulk-import/blob/master/import.md) | Import FHIR Resources from a source| see the [user guide](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/guides/FHIRServerUsersGuide#4101-bulk-data-export) for config info.

By default, the server will look for a tenantId in a `X-FHIR-TENANT-ID` header and a datastoreId in the `X-FHIR-DSID` header, and use `default` for either one if the headers are not present.\n\n### General parameters\nThe `_format` parameter is supported and provides a useful mechanism for requesting a specific format (`XML` or `JSON`) in requests made from a browser. In the absence of either an `Accept` header or a `_format` query parameter, the server defaults to `application/fhir+json`.\n\nThe `_pretty` parameter is also supported.\n\n## Search\nThe IBM FHIR Server supports all search parameter types defined in the specification:\n* `Number`\n* `Date/DateTime`\n* `String`\n* `Token`\n* `Reference`\n* `Composite`\n* `Quantity`\n* `URI`\n* `Special` (Location-near)\n\n### Search parameters\nSearch parameters defined in the specification can be found by browsing the R4 FHIR specification by resource type. For example, to find the search parameters for the Patient resource, navigate to https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/patient.html and scroll to the Search Parameters section near the end of the page.\n\nIn addition, the following search parameters are supported on all resources:\n* `_id`\n* `_lastUpdated`\n* `_tag`\n* `_profile`\n* `_security`\n* `_source`\n* `_type`\n* `_has`\n\nThese parameters can be used while searching any single resource type or while searching across resource types (whole system search).\nThe `_type` parameter is special in that it is only applicable for whole system search. The `_has` parameter has two restrictions:\n* `_has` cannot be used with whole system search.\n* The search parameter specified at the end of its chain cannot be a search result parameter.\n\nThe `_text`, `_content`, `_list`, `_query`, and `_filter` parameters are not supported at this time.\n\nFinally, the specification defines a set of \"Search result parameters\" for controlling the search behavior. The IBM FHIR Server supports the following:\n* `_sort`\n* `_count`\n* `_include`\n* `_revinclude`\n* `_summary`\n* `_elements`\n\nThe `_count` parameter can be used to request up to 1000 records matching the search criteria.  An attempt to exceed this `_count` limit will not be honored and returned records will be capped at 1000.  Any associated `_include` records are not considered in the `_count` limit. \n\nThe `:iterate` modifier is not supported for the `_include` parameter (or any other).\n\nThe `:missing` modifier is not supported for whole-system search.\n\nThe `_total`, `_contained`, and `_containedType` parameters are not supported at this time.\n\n### Custom search parameters\nCustom search parameters are search parameters that are not defined in the FHIR R4 specification, but are configured for search on the IBM FHIR Server. You can configure custom parameters for either extension elements or for elements that are defined in the specification but without a corresponding search parameter.\n\nFor information on how to specify custom search parameters, see [FHIRSearchConfiguration.md](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/guides/FHIRSearchConfiguration).\n\n### Search modifiers\nFHIR search modifiers are described at https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/search.html#modifiers and vary by search parameter type. The IBM FHIR Server implements a subset of the spec-defined search modifiers that is defined in the following table:\n\n|FHIR Search Parameter Type|Supported Modifiers|\"Default\" search behavior when no Modifier or Prefix is present|\n|--------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n|String                    |`:exact`,`:contains`,`:missing` |\"starts with\" search that is case-insensitive and accent-insensitive|\n|Reference                 |`:[type]`,`:missing`            |exact match search and targets are implicitly added|\n|URI                       |`:below`,`:above`,`:missing`    |exact match search|\n|Token                     |`:missing`                      |exact match search|\n|Number                    |`:missing`                      |implicit range search (see http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/search.html#number)|\n|Date                      |`:missing`                      |implicit range search (see https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#date)|\n|Quantity                  |`:missing`                      |implicit range search (see http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/search.html#quantity)|\n|Composite                 |`:missing`                      |processes each parameter component according to its type|\n|Special (near)            | none                           |searches a bounding area according to the value of the `fhirServer/search/useBoundingRadius` property|\n\nDue to performance implications, the `:exact` modifier should be used for String searches where possible.\n\nAt present, the `:missing` modifier is not supported for whole-system search nor for chained parameter search. For example, a search with query string like `subject:Basic.date:missing` will result in an `OperationOutcome` explaining that the search parameter could not be processed.\n\nThe :text, :not, :above, :below, :in, :not-in, and :of-type modifiers are not supported in this version of the IBM FHIR server and use of this modifier will results in an HTTP 400 error with an OperationOutcome that describes the failure.\n\n### Search prefixes\nFHIR search prefixes are described at https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/search.html#prefix.\n\nAs defined in the specification, the following prefixes are supported for Number, Date, and Quantity search parameters:\n* `eq`\n* `ne`\n* `gt`\n* `lt`\n* `gt`\n* `le`\n* `sa`\n* `eb`\n* `ap`\n\nFor range targets (parameter values extracted from Range, Date/Period, and DateTime elements without fractional seconds), the prefixes are interpreted as according to https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/search.html#prefix.\n\nFor example, a search like `Observation?date=2018-10-29T12:00:00Z` would *not* match an Observation with an effectivePeriod of `start=2018-10-29` and `end=2018-10-30` because \"the search range does not fully contain the range of the target value.\" Similarly, a search like `range=5||mg` would not match a range value with `low = 1 mg` and `high = 10 mg`. To obtain all range values which contain a specific value, use the `ap` prefix which is defined to match when \"the range of the search value overlaps with the range of the target value.\"\n\nIf not specified on a query string, the default prefix is `eq`.\n\n### Searching on Date\nThe IBM FHIR Server implements date search as according to the specification.\n\nThe server supports up to 6 fractional seconds (microsecond granularity) for Instant and DateTime values and all extracted parameter values are stored in the database in UTC in order to improve data portability.\n\nDates and DateTimes which are expressed without timezones are assumed to be in the local timezone of the application server at the time of parameter extraction.\nSimilarly, query parameter date values with no timezone are assumed to be in the local timezone of the server at the time the search is invoked.\nTo ensure consistency of search results, clients are recommended to include the timezone on all search query values that include a time.\n\nFinally, the server extends the specified capabilities with support for \"exact match\" semantics on fractional seconds.\n\nQuery parameter values without fractional seconds are handled as an implicit range. For example, a search like `Observatoin?date=2019-01-01T12:00:00Z` would return resources with the following effectiveDateTime values:\n* 2019-01-01T12:00:00Z\n* 2019-01-01T12:00:00.1Z\n* 2019-01-01T12:00:00.999999Z\n\nQuery parameter values with fractional seconds are handled with exact match semantics (ignoring precision). For example, a search like `Patient?birthdate=2019-01-01T12:00:00.1Z` would include resources with the following effectiveDateTime values:\n* 2019-01-01T12:00:00.1Z\n* 2019-01-01T12:00:00.100Z\n* 2019-01-01T12:00:00.100000Z\n\nIndexing fields of type `Timing` is not well-defined in the specification and is not supported in this version of the IBM FHIR Server.\n\n### Searching on Token\nFor search parameters of type token, resource values are not indexed unless the resource instance contains both a `system` **and** `code`. The server implements the following variations of token search defined in the specification:\n* `[parameter]=[code]`\n* `[parameter]=[system]|[code]`\n* `[parameter]=|[code]`\n\nHowever, the `|[code]` variant currently behaves like the `[code]` option, matching code values irrespective of the system instead of matching only on elements with missing/null system values as defined in the spec.\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server does not yet support searching a token value by codesystem, irrespective of the value (`|[system]|`).\n\nFor search parameters of type token that are defined on data fields of type `ContactPoint`, the FHIR server currently uses the `ContactPoint.system` and the `ContactPoint.value` instead of the `ContactPoint.use` field as described in the specification.\n\nSearching string values via a token search parameter is not currently supported.\n\n### Searching on Number\nFor fields of type `decimal`, the IBM FHIR Server computes an implicit range when the query parameter value has a prefix of `eq` (the default), `ne`, or `ap`. The computed range is based on the number of significant figures passed in the query string and further information can be found at https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/search.html#number.\nFor searches with the `ap` prefix, we use the range `[implicitLowerBound - searchQueryValue * .1, implicitUpperBound + searchQueryValue * .1)` to ensure that the `ap` range is broader than the implicit range of `eq`.\n\n### Searching on Quantity\nQuantity elements are not indexed unless they include either a valid `system` **and** `code` for their unit **or** a human-readable `unit` field.\nIf a Quantity element contains both a coded unit **and** a display unit, then both will be indexed. Quantities that don't include a `value` element are also skipped.\n\nThe FHIR server does not perform any unit conversion or unit manipulation at this time. Quantity values should be searched using the same unit `code` that is included in the original resource.\n\nSimilar to Numeric searches, the FHIR Server computes an implicit range for search query values with no range prefix (e.g. `eq`, `ne`, `ap`) based on the number of significant figures passed in the query string.\nFor searches with the `ap` prefix, we use the range `[implicitLowerBound - searchQueryValue * .1, implicitUpperBound + searchQueryValue * .1)` to ensure that the `ap` range is broader than the implicit range of `eq`.\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server does not consider the `Quantity.comparator` field as part of search processing at this time.\n\n### Searching on URI\nURI searches on the IBM FHIR Server are case-sensitive with \"exact-match\" semantics. The `above` and `below` prefixes can be used to perform path-based matching that is based on the `/` delimiter.\n\n### Searching on Reference\nReference searches on the IBM FHIR Server support search on:\n\n* a relative reference - `1` where it is reflexsively determined to be a subset of possible targets, such as `Patient/1`, `Group/1`\n* a logical reference - `Patient/1` where it is explicitly set\n* uri searches - where it is explicitly searched using a URI on the server, such as `reference=http://example.org/fhir/Patient/123`\n\nWe recommend using logical reference where possible.\n\n### Searching on Special Positional Search\nPositional Search uses [UCUM units](https://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html) of distance measure along with common variants:\n\n| Unit of Measure | Variant |\n|-----------------|---------|\n|KILOMETERS|km, kms, kilometer, kilometers|\n|MILES|mi, mis, mile, miles|\n|METERS|m, ms, meter, meters|\n|FEET|ft, fts, foot|\n\nNote, the use of the surrounding bracket, such as `[mi_us]` is optional; `mi_us` is also valid.\n\n## HL7 FHIR R4 (v4.0.1) errata\nWe add information here as we find issues with the artifacts provided with this version of the specification.\n\nFHIR® is the registered trademark of HL7 and is used with the permission of HL7.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"4625d3ebc9afba0dddf0aa81ec160105","counter":98,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","fieldOwners":{"slug":"gatsby-plugin-slug"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Conformance","layout":"post","description":"Notes on the Conformance of the IBM FHIR Server","date":"2020-11-03 01:00:00 -0400","permalink":"/conformance/"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\nlayout: post\ntitle:  Conformance\ndescription: Notes on the Conformance of the IBM FHIR Server\ndate:   2020-11-03 01:00:00 -0400\npermalink: /conformance/\n---\n\n# Conformance to the HL7 FHIR Specification\nThe IBM FHIR Server aims to be a conformant implementation of the HL7 FHIR specification, version 4.0.1 (R4).

The IBM FHIR Server supports the following:\n* `_sort`\n* `_count`\n* `_include`\n* `_revinclude`\n* `_summary`\n* `_elements`\n\nThe `_count` parameter can be used to request up to 1000 records matching the search criteria.  An attempt to exceed this `_count` limit will not be honored and returned records will be capped at 1000.  Any associated `_include` records are not considered in the `_count` limit. \n\nThe `:iterate` modifier is not supported for the `_include` parameter (or any other).\n\nThe `:missing` modifier is not supported for whole-system search.\n\nThe `_total`, `_contained`, and `_containedType` parameters are not supported at this time.\n\n### Custom search parameters\nCustom search parameters are search parameters that are not defined in the FHIR R4 specification, but are configured for search on the IBM FHIR Server. You can configure custom parameters for either extension elements or for elements that are defined in the specification but without a corresponding search parameter.\n\nFor information on how to specify custom search parameters, see [FHIRSearchConfiguration.md](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/guides/FHIRSearchConfiguration).\n\n### Search modifiers\nFHIR search modifiers are described at https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/search.html#modifiers and vary by search parameter type. The IBM FHIR Server implements a subset of the spec-defined search modifiers that is defined in the following table:\n\n|FHIR Search Parameter Type|Supported Modifiers|\"Default\" search behavior when no Modifier or Prefix is present|\n|--------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n|String                    |`:exact`,`:contains`,`:missing` |\"starts with\" search that is case-insensitive and accent-insensitive|\n|Reference                 |`:[type]`,`:missing`            |exact match search and targets are implicitly added|\n|URI                       |`:below`,`:above`,`:missing`    |exact match search|\n|Token                     |`:missing`                      |exact match search|\n|Number                    |`:missing`                      |implicit range search (see http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/search.html#number)|\n|Date                      |`:missing`                      |implicit range search (see https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#date)|\n|Quantity                  |`:missing`                      |implicit range search (see http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/search.html#quantity)|\n|Composite                 |`:missing`                      |processes each parameter component according to its type|\n|Special (near)            | none                           |searches a bounding area according to the value of the `fhirServer/search/useBoundingRadius` property|\n\nDue to performance implications, the `:exact` modifier should be used for String searches where possible.\n\nAt present, the `:missing` modifier is not supported for whole-system search nor for chained parameter search. For example, a search with query string like `subject:Basic.date:missing` will result in an `OperationOutcome` explaining that the search parameter could not be processed.\n\nThe :text, :not, :above, :below, :in, :not-in, and :of-type modifiers are not supported in this version of the IBM FHIR server and use of this modifier will results in an HTTP 400 error with an OperationOutcome that describes the failure.\n\n### Search prefixes\nFHIR search prefixes are described at https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/search.html#prefix.\n\nAs defined in the specification, the following prefixes are supported for Number, Date, and Quantity search parameters:\n* `eq`\n* `ne`\n* `gt`\n* `lt`\n* `gt`\n* `le`\n* `sa`\n* `eb`\n* `ap`\n\nFor range targets (parameter values extracted from Range, Date/Period, and DateTime elements without fractional seconds), the prefixes are interpreted as according to https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/search.html#prefix.\n\nFor example, a search like `Observation?date=2018-10-29T12:00:00Z` would *not* match an Observation with an effectivePeriod of `start=2018-10-29` and `end=2018-10-30` because \"the search range does not fully contain the range of the target value.\" Similarly, a search like `range=5||mg` would not match a range value with `low = 1 mg` and `high = 10 mg`. To obtain all range values which contain a specific value, use the `ap` prefix which is defined to match when \"the range of the search value overlaps with the range of the target value.\"\n\nIf not specified on a query string, the default prefix is `eq`.\n\n### Searching on Date\nThe IBM FHIR Server implements date search as according to the specification.\n\nThe server supports up to 6 fractional seconds (microsecond granularity) for Instant and DateTime values and all extracted parameter values are stored in the database in UTC in order to improve data portability.\n\nDates and DateTimes which are expressed without timezones are assumed to be in the local timezone of the application server at the time of parameter extraction.\nSimilarly, query parameter date values with no timezone are assumed to be in the local timezone of the server at the time the search is invoked.\nTo ensure consistency of search results, clients are recommended to include the timezone on all search query values that include a time.\n\nFinally, the server extends the specified capabilities with support for \"exact match\" semantics on fractional seconds.\n\nQuery parameter values without fractional seconds are handled as an implicit range. For example, a search like `Observatoin?date=2019-01-01T12:00:00Z` would return resources with the following effectiveDateTime values:\n* 2019-01-01T12:00:00Z\n* 2019-01-01T12:00:00.1Z\n* 2019-01-01T12:00:00.999999Z\n\nQuery parameter values with fractional seconds are handled with exact match semantics (ignoring precision). For example, a search like `Patient?birthdate=2019-01-01T12:00:00.1Z` would include resources with the following effectiveDateTime values:\n* 2019-01-01T12:00:00.1Z\n* 2019-01-01T12:00:00.100Z\n* 2019-01-01T12:00:00.100000Z\n\nIndexing fields of type `Timing` is not well-defined in the specification and is not supported in this version of the IBM FHIR Server.\n\n### Searching on Token\nFor search parameters of type token, resource values are not indexed unless the resource instance contains both a `system` **and** `code`. The server implements the following variations of token search defined in the specification:\n* `[parameter]=[code]`\n* `[parameter]=[system]|[code]`\n* `[parameter]=|[code]`\n\nHowever, the `|[code]` variant currently behaves like the `[code]` option, matching code values irrespective of the system instead of matching only on elements with missing/null system values as defined in the spec.\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server does not yet support searching a token value by codesystem, irrespective of the value (`|[system]|`).\n\nFor search parameters of type token that are defined on data fields of type `ContactPoint`, the FHIR server currently uses the `ContactPoint.system` and the `ContactPoint.value` instead of the `ContactPoint.use` field as described in the specification.\n\nSearching string values via a token search parameter is not currently supported.\n\n### Searching on Number\nFor fields of type `decimal`, the IBM FHIR Server computes an implicit range when the query parameter value has a prefix of `eq` (the default), `ne`, or `ap`. The computed range is based on the number of significant figures passed in the query string and further information can be found at https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/search.html#number.\nFor searches with the `ap` prefix, we use the range `[implicitLowerBound - searchQueryValue * .1, implicitUpperBound + searchQueryValue * .1)` to ensure that the `ap` range is broader than the implicit range of `eq`.\n\n### Searching on Quantity\nQuantity elements are not indexed unless they include either a valid `system` **and** `code` for their unit **or** a human-readable `unit` field.\nIf a Quantity element contains both a coded unit **and** a display unit, then both will be indexed. Quantities that don't include a `value` element are also skipped.\n\nThe FHIR server does not perform any unit conversion or unit manipulation at this time. Quantity values should be searched using the same unit `code` that is included in the original resource.\n\nSimilar to Numeric searches, the FHIR Server computes an implicit range for search query values with no range prefix (e.g. `eq`, `ne`, `ap`) based on the number of significant figures passed in the query string.\nFor searches with the `ap` prefix, we use the range `[implicitLowerBound - searchQueryValue * .1, implicitUpperBound + searchQueryValue * .1)` to ensure that the `ap` range is broader than the implicit range of `eq`.\n\nThe IBM FHIR Server does not consider the `Quantity.comparator` field as part of search processing at this time.\n\n### Searching on URI\nURI searches on the IBM FHIR Server are case-sensitive with \"exact-match\" semantics. The `above` and `below` prefixes can be used to perform path-based matching that is based on the `/` delimiter.\n\n### Searching on Reference\nReference searches on the IBM FHIR Server support search on:\n\n* a relative reference - `1` where it is reflexsively determined to be a subset of possible targets, such as `Patient/1`, `Group/1`\n* a logical reference - `Patient/1` where it is explicitly set\n* uri searches - where it is explicitly searched using a URI on the server, such as `reference=http://example.org/fhir/Patient/123`\n\nWe recommend using logical reference where possible.\n\n### Searching on Special Positional Search\nPositional Search uses [UCUM units](https://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html) of distance measure along with common variants:\n\n| Unit of Measure | Variant |\n|-----------------|---------|\n|KILOMETERS|km, kms, kilometer, kilometers|\n|MILES|mi, mis, mile, miles|\n|METERS|m, ms, meter, meters|\n|FEET|ft, fts, foot|\n\nNote, the use of the surrounding bracket, such as `[mi_us]` is optional; `mi_us` is also valid.\n\n## HL7 FHIR R4 (v4.0.1) errata\nWe add information here as we find issues with the artifacts provided with this version of the specification.\n\nFHIR® is the registered trademark of HL7 and is used with the permission of HL7.\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/FHIR/FHIR/fhir/docs/src/pages/Conformance.md","fields":{"slug":"/Conformance"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","2102389209","2102389209","227138135","227138135","2456312558","2746626797","2746626797","3018647132","3018647132","3906363820","3906363820","768070550"]}
